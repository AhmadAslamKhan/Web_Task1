            Do you like something packed with action, fantasy, romanace or just are fascinated by the concept of next level VR. If so this anime is right up your alley. It has all of these and more. Altough the first arc of the anime is phenomenal and makes it one of my all time favorite. The only downside of the anime is the following arcs are not up to power with the first one.

            Haikyu!! is all about sports, light hearted comedy and a healthy rivalry. Haikyu!! is my favorite sports anime of all time. The animation and character development are all top tier. Haikyuu has a way of showing character backstories in a way that youll go through their journey. The anime shows you scenes that will give you goosebumps through out the show. Overall its a must watch anime.
